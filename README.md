# WEBFISHING Guitar Player

This project enhances the WEBFISHING game by providing a guitar-playing feature that runs in the background while you play.
There is a discord server [here](https://discord.gg/7WtemYDazb) for sharing MIDI files, feel free to join and contribute your own MIDIs.


## Overview

WEBFISHING Guitar Player consists of two main components:

1. **MIDIProcessor**: Converts and prepares MIDI files for use in the game.
2. **Guitar Player**: Plays the processed MIDI files as guitar sounds in WEBFISHING.

## Key Features

- Plays guitar sounds while WEBFISHING runs in the background
- Supports MIDI notes within the range of 40 to 79 (39-note range)
- Processes MIDI files to fit the game's musical constraints
- Automatically adjusts note scales to maximize playable notes

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- WEBFISHING game installed
- MIDI files you want to play (place them in a "midi" folder) (I have included a folder of already processed songs too)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the latest release.
2. Ensure you have a "midi" folder containing the MIDI files you want to use.

### Usage

#### Step 1: Process MIDI Files

1. Run the MIDIProcessor executable.
2. The program will create a "songs" folder containing the processed files.
3. A conversion_stats.txt file will be generated, detailing how many notes were adapted or lost during processing.

#### Step 2: Play Guitar in WEBFISHING

1. Start the WEBFISHING game.
2. Launch the Guitar Player executable.
3. In WEBFISHING, start playing the guitar.
4. In the Guitar Player, select a song from the processed list and click "Play".

## Important Notes

- The game only supports notes from 40 to 79. Notes outside this range will be adapted or omitted.
- The MIDIProcessor will attempt to adjust note scales to maximize the number of playable notes within the supported range.
- For the best experience, consider arranging your MIDI files to fit within the supported note range before processing.
- Always start the guitar in WEBFISHING before selecting and playing a song in the Guitar Player.

## MIDIProcessor Details

The MIDIProcessor is a crucial component of this project. It performs the following tasks:

1. Reads MIDI files from the "midi" folder.
2. Analyzes the note range of each MIDI file.
3. Attempts to adjust the note scales to fit within the 40-79 range, maximizing the number of playable notes.
5. Saves the processed files in the "songs" folder.
6. Generates a conversion_stats.txt file with information about the processing results.

This processing ensures that your MIDI files are optimized for the best possible performance within WEBFISHING's limited note range.
